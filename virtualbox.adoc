= Specific instructions when using virtualbox

== Pointing device

Before booting in a system, live or otherwise, choose in settings/system/pointing device the appropriate one:
- if you use xorg, go for PS/2 Mouse
- if not, using USB tablet will preven the console from uselessly capturing your mouse (requiring the use of the vbox mod key to escape from it)


== EFI booting problems

When rebooting on a newly created system with an EFI/gpt partitioning type (after the live CD session), virtualbox may fail to work, leaving you in a UEFI interactive shell. Its keyboard will be US. Two ways to deal with it:

the temporary solution: to boot once on your new system, type

    Shell> fs0:efi\xxxx\grubx64.efi

/!\ the antislash of qwerty is on the [Âµ] key
case-insensitive, xxxx is the --bootloader-id you gave to grub-install (usually is 'grub'), and it may be tab-completed (not the name of the .efi file though).

the long-term solution: to make virtualbox boot automatically on your new system, type

    Shell> edit startup.nsh
    \EFI\grub\grubx64.efi

Ctrl+E to get help, Ctrl+W to exit help, Ctrl+S to save file, Ctrl+Q to quit editor. WARNING: US keyboard!!!
This will create a file /boot/startup.nsh which will be used by virtualbox to boot properly.
Alternatively, you can create the file from inside the live CD, before rebooting:

    $ echo '\EFI\grub\grubx64.efi' > /mnt/boot/startup.nsh


== Shared Folder

within your new system: you need to have enabled virtualbox-guest-utils(-modules-arch). then you create/edit

    $ vim /etc/modules-load.d/virtualbox.conf
    vboxguest
    vboxsf
    vboxvideo
    $ reboot

to manually mount


    $ mkdir /mnt/shared
    $ mount -t vboxsf name_of_shared_folder /mnt/shared

to add an entry for it to fstab, you need the options used to mount it:

    $ mount                   # or mount -l
    $ findmnt | grep shared   # better alternative


== Remarks

- ping often doesn work in a vm even when you have an internet connection working from within it
