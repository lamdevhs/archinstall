= Part II: first boot -- 5-packages
:hardbreaks:

Where we install basic useful tools.


== SOUND

    r$ pacman -S alsa-utils

as user:

    login: myuser
    u$ alsamixer

F6 to select the sound card, Esc to exit, arrow keys to select and modify. try to put everything to "dB gain: 0.0".
M to mute/unmute channels.

If one day you can't play some music, here are some codecs you may try to install. You're still better off waiting for actually needing them. Try perhaps to install vlc before especially, as it ships with many codecs.

    r$ pacman -S libmad    # for reading mp3 files
    r$ pacman -S gstreamer
    r$ pacman -S gst-plugins-{backend,base,base-libs,good,ugly,espeak}
    r$ pacman -S lame faad2 flac gstreamer lib{dca,dv,dvdcss,dvdread,dvdnav,mpeg2,theora,vorbis,xv}

== BASIC TERMINAL TOOLS

log back to root.

packages already previously installed:

    r$ pacman -S vim terminus-font ranger elinks lynx
    r$ pacman -S sudo
    r$ pacman -S alsa-utils

basic very useful command line tools:

    r$ pacman -S wget tree

very useful for recovery/disk maintenance:

    r$ pacman -S parted testdisk

terminal software:

    r$ pacman -S cmus  # music player

/!\ in general it fails to work at first. cf Part III.


== CMUS (WIP)

=== VM

- after installing it: can be launched as normal user but can't see any mp3 music when exploring (tab 5)
- pacman -Qi says we need libmad for mp3
- after installing libmad: the mp3 files become visible, and we can actually play them, both as normal user and root user
- libmad is one of the dependencies of vlc

=== HARD DISK
- without libmad, mp3 aren't visible, like in vm. we get a warning error at startup that disappears once we download libmad
but we still can't play music: we in fact require libpulse, which is one of the optional dependencies:
                  libpulse: for PulseAudio output plugin support
and yet it's not enough...
