= Part I: live CD -- installing -- fstab

The command that generates the fstab file for the new system
is genfstab.

Before generation /mnt/etc/fstab, it may be useful to mount
all the partitions you'll want automatically mounted everytime
you'll boot onto your new system, in various mounting points
anywhere inside /mnt (which represents your future root '/' filesystem).

Especially, you'll want to swapon any swap partition you'll want automatically
swapped on by your new system.
TODO: check if this actually works

Generate the file:

    $ genfstab -Up /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
    $ cat /mnt/etc/fstab   # check its content
