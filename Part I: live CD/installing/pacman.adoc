= Part I: live CD -- installing -- pacman

The installation of the new system in /mnt is going to download
all the required packages from the internet. So we have to get the best
mirrorlist possible.

    $ MLIST='www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=FR&protocol=http&protocol=https&ip_version=4'
    $ wget "$MLIST"    # creates a new file called index?<stuff>
    $ mv ./index<tab> /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Then uncomment some (all?) of the mirror links in the list:

    $ vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

To get total percentage of download progress during installation, and a much prettier
display, uncomment the two lines:

    $ vim /etc/pacman.conf
    Color
    TotalDownload
