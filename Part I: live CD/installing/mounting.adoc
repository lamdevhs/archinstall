= Part I: live CD -- installing -- mounting

We must mount the partitions that we'll install the new arch system in,
so they can become accessible to tools for creating files and folders.

== Mount the main filesystem '/' partition on the folder /mnt

    $ mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

== If you have an EFI boot partition:

    $ mkdir /mnt/boot
    $ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

Assuming /dev/sda1 is the EFI boot partition

Check the efi flag of the boot partition: ok if this path exists

    $ ls /mnt/boot/EFI

== Mount the swap partition

    $ swapon /dev/sda3

== Check everything

    $ lsblk
    $ ls /mnt
