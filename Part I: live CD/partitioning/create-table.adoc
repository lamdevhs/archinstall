This operation erases everything on the disk: all partitions previously there are deleted
Skip this step if you want to keep what is currently on this disk

Execute either of those:

    (parted) mklabel gpt      # if you want a GPT disk table
    (parted) mklabel msdos    # if you want an msdos disk table

Checking

    (parted) print free
