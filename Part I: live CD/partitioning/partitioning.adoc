= Part I: live CD -- partitioning

Using parted

== Useful to know

    (parted) help somecommand     # displays a lot of useful info

Incase you need to recuperate some lost partitions after a mistake

    $ pacman -Sy testdisk
    $ testdisk

== Assessing

The disks and their partitions

    $ ls /dev/sd*     # what disks?
    $ fdisk -l /dev/sda      # what partitions already exist?
    $ blkid     # idem
    $ parted /dev/sda unit GiB print free     # idem

Enter the parted program, which then uses its own prompt

    $ parted /dev/sda
    (parted) unit MiB        # set up the default unit for display and input
